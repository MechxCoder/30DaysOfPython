1. Modules
A module in Python is simply a file containing Python code (usually functions, classes, and variables)
that you can reuse in other Python programs. Modules help organize code and keep it modular, making it easier to manage and understand.

Types of Modules:
Built-in Modules:       These are modules that come pre-installed with Python, such as math, date time, os, etc.
User-Defined Modules:   You can create your own modules by saving Python code in a file with a .py extension.
 
For example, if you save code in a file named my_module.py, you can import it in other Python files using:

(import my_module )   code or syntax for importing your own module 
Example:

(my_module.py)
def greet(name):
return f"Hello, {name}!"
(another_file.py)
import my_module
print (my_module.greet("Rutik")) 
# Output: Hello, Rutik!(this will only work if you first create your own module)



2. Pip
Pip is the package installer for Python. It allows you to install and manage additional libraries 
and dependencies that aren't part of the Python standard library.These libraries are often shared on the Python Package Index (PyPI).

 Using Pip:
To install a package, you use:

pip install package_name
Example: To install the popular requests library: '''
